# engagement_tracker

The Engagement Tracker application aims to streamline and simplify the way employees track the tasks of customer engagements they are aligned to. Each Engagement has one or more Tasks. These are then assigned to a single user (employee). Within the application, users can view the list of engagements within the master details page, including search functionality. When an engagement is clicked on, its associated tasks can be viewed with the option to add more tasks. Selecting a specific Task on an Engagement will open a Details page, where Task attributes can be updated and set as complete. Completed Tasks are striked-through and are indicated by a green circle, whereas incomplete tasks have greyed-out circles.


To run the app:

python manage.py runserver
